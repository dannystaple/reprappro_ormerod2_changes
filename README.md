# Improvements to a Reprappro Ormerod 2 Printer.

Modifications made by a relatively inexperienced 3D printer user.

# Part 437 - Z Stop

The original part design from RepRapPro had a few flaws. It had a goose-neck to a screw, this was a weak point, and where the original part shipped to me from RepRapPro failed. 

The other weak point is that the original would snap fit around the Z bearing rod. This design led to it being designed to flex across a thin strip. This failed twice on replacements. 

My modifications to this are:
* Replace the goose neck with a thicker section. This should not interfere with other parts.
* replace the "snap fit" with a larger cylinder, and a screw/clamp based system.

This is as yet untested - once a first print has been made, fixes can be attempted.
It needs also an M3 screw + nut. 

# Drag Chain

The other parts form a drag chaing, with an additional link designed to hang on the Ormerod.
